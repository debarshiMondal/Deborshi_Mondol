See the input. And create me a script which will give me last two author log, date, comment in seperate coloumns of the classes.

Classes should be append with .cls and are located at src/classes folder.

 last two author log, date, comment in seperate coloumns of the classes.


First class name, author, comment, date, method name and then error.

Header of the web page will be TestClass Failure Report.

Then Code Coverage Failure report

First class name, author, comment, date, and then error.

The python script will create a html file with date in /data/public/testclass_failure_report/ folder.

So that web page can be visible. Create a very beautiful web page repport.

the input will be pasted in a testclass_report.txt file in the same location as the script.

The ENV_SYNC Dashboard focuses on producing a small set of clear, technical outputs across four UI modules:

1. /dashboard — Global Status Outputs

Latest Master Sync summary card

Last run timestamp and duration

Status: Success / Failed (with short reason)

API version from latest production dump

Key counts:

Files only in Prod

Files only in Master

Common files with content differences

Latest Branch Sync summary

Per-branch status snapshot (or “No recent branch sync”)

High-level counts of changed/missing files per branch

Alerts / Notifications

Recent Master Sync failures (dump, validation, diff failures, etc.)

Recent Branch Sync failures (per branch)

Each alert provides a direct link to the detailed module view.

2. /master-sync — Master vs PROD Outputs

a) Control & Status Zone

Buttons:

Generate Master Sync Report

Schedule Master Sync Report

b) Latest Report Cards

Outputs for the most recent run:

Run metadata

Run timestamp

Duration (previous run → current run)

API version (derived from dump name)

File delta metrics

Count + CSV link:

Files in Prod dump missing in Master

Files in Master missing in Prod

Common files with content differences

Combined Changed + Missing files

CSV with file path, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedDate, and DevOps comment bucket

Artifacts / links

Code Comparison HTML report (Beyond Compare)

Master dump reference (previous execution)

Production dump reference (current execution)

Link to Master_Update_Files directory (deployment-ready subset)

c) History Table

Tabular output for multiple past runs:

Timestamp

Status (Success / FAILED_PROD_DUMP / FAILED_FOLDER_VALIDATION / etc.)

Production dump name

Key counts (Prod-only, Master-only, Diff files)

Links:

Run folder

CSV exports

Code compare report

3. /branch-sync — Master vs Live Branch Outputs

a) Input & Discovery Area

Live Branch list derived from ~/.bashrc:

Branch name (e.g. 2025-q4nov-release)

GitHub link: https://github.cadence.com/IT/SFDC/tree/{branch}

Controls:

Mode: Single branch / All branches

Branch dropdown (for single)

Start Branch Sync button

b) Branch Report Cards (per run)

For each processed branch (1 or many):

Branch name + sandbox alias

Run timestamp and duration

Metrics:

Files in Master missing in Branch

Files in Branch missing in Master

Common files with content differences

Combined Changed + Missing set size

Author information:

Summary of latest commit authors per file (e.g. “Top 5 authors involved”)

Links:

CSV exports for each file set

Detailed diff views (labels, custom settings, file lists)

Optional branch-level code compare report

c) Detailed Diff Views

Per branch:

Custom Labels diff view

Table of label names with:

Master value

Branch value

Status: Different / Missing in Master / Missing in Branch

Equal values are suppressed; mismatches and missing items are highlighted.

Custom Settings diff view

Table keyed by NAME (e.g. TSMC_Helper__c rows):

Master VALUE__c

Branch VALUE__c

Status: Different / Missing in Master / Missing in Branch

Equal rows are hidden; mismatches and missing keys highlighted.

File-level lists

Paginated tables and CSVs for:

Master-only files

Branch-only files

Content-diff files

4. /branch_sync_runs — Branch Sync History Outputs

History table of all branch sync executions

Timestamp

Branch name

Status (Success / Failure)

Summary metrics (missing / changed file counts)

Link to open that run’s branch-report view in /branch-sync

Optional filters:

By branch

By status

By date range

This gives you a technical, UI-focused view of what the system surfaces: status cards, delta metrics, CSV exports, diff reports, and history tables—without any backend pipeline details.
